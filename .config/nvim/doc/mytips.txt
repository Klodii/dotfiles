|whole-line-completion| in insert mode.
After editing a command, you can:

DEV DEBUGGING                                               *mytips-debugging*
During development you might find useful to print log messages.
In this example you can see how to write them.

>lua
    local log = require "plenary.log":new()
    log.level = 'debug'
    local random_table = { message = 'This is a debug log' }
    log.debug(random_table)
<

To read them you just have to execute |:messages|.
It will display all the log messages, to check the latest messages you have to
go ad the end of them.
