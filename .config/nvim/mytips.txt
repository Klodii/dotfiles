DEV DEBUGGING
During development you might find useful to print log messages.
In this example you can see how to write them.

```lua
local log = require "plenary.log":new()
log.level = 'debug'
local random_table = { message = 'This is a debug log' }
log.debug(random_table)
```

To read them you just have to execute `:messages`.
It will display all the log messages, to check the latest messages you have to
go ad the end of them.
