## How to install plugins
The plugin manager is "[Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)",
you have to install it to be able to run the plugins.
Follow the Packer README to install it.

After the installation go to the `~/.config/nvim/lua/klaudjan/packer.lua`
and open the file with nvim, then execute the following commands

1. `:so` to source the script in the file
2. `:PackerSync` to execute the Packer, that will install all plugins listend
in the file.

## Project composition
- **after**, in this folder are intsalled all the plugin configurations
- **init.lua**, first file that is readed by nvim
- **lua**, folder in which are located all the keymaps, options, autocommands and
plugin definitions
- **plugin**: folder generated by Packer
- **pfplugin**: in this folder are located configurations for specific file types. The configurations will be loaded when the relative filetype is loaded (the configuration remain loaded even you change file with a different file type). If the configurations are not loaded make sure that you have  set `:filetype on` and
`:filetype plugin on`

## Checkhealt
To optimize or check if there are some warnings or errors run `:checkhealt`.
If there is any error, try to run `:TSUpdate`, the udpate might fix the error.


## Language Server Protocol (LSP)
LSP is used to make nvim understand the language you are using and giving you
suggestion messages.
If you do not see something like this when you open your file check if the
language you are using is presente in the installed list of Mason (`:Mason`).
Mason is the plugin that handles the languages.

### LSP servers that I use
You may need to install `npm` to install these servers through Mason
- bash-language-server: Bash
- dockerfile-language-server: Docker
- html-lsp: HTML
- json-lsp: JSON
- ltex-ls: Text, Markdown, LaTeX
- pyright: Python
- sqlls: SQL
- taplo: TOML
- vim-language-server: VimScript
- yaml-language-server: YAML



# VIM usefull keys
`^` = `Ctrl`

Movements
    Visual mode: `0` goes to beginning of the line
    Visual mode: `_` or `^` goes to first non-blank character of the line
    Visual mode: `g_` goes to the last non-blank character of the line
    Visual mode: `_vg_` will select from first non-blank character to last non-blank character

Indentation
    - Insert mode: `^-t`, `^-d` to indent current line forward, backwords
    - Visual mode: `>`, `<` to indent current line forward, backwords
    - Visual mode: `=` to make vim autoindent correctly the selected rows

Upper/Lower case
    - Normal mode:
        - `~` change to upper/lower case the character under the cursor
        - `gu<movement>` to make lowercase all character found in the movement
        - `gU<movement>` to make uppercase all character found in the movement

Record commands
    - Normal mode:
        - `q<a-z>` to begin record all keys and commands executed. The recording
                   goes to the <a-z> character selected (aka the alfanumeric
                   register selected).
        - `@<a-z><movement>` to execute the recorded commands
Registers:
    - To list all registers content: `:registers` or `:reg`
    - To paste the content of a register X:
        - Normal mode: `"Xp"`
        - Insert mode: `<^-r>X"
    - To yank (copy) to a specific register you have to prepend your yank
      command with the register name X:
        - Normal mode: `"Xyw` (to yank the word to the register X)

Close suggestion window:
    - Insert mode:
        - `^-e` to open/close the suggestion window that appear while you are typing


Open history list:
Vim can show and make you select the previous commands/searched executed,
opening a command-line window
    - Type `q:` for commands, or `q/` for searches; or
    - Type `:` or `/` to start entering a command or search, then press the 'cedit' key (default is `Ctrl-f` :help 'cedit').
The advantage of the command-line window is that you can use all Vim's editing power, including searching with '/' in normal mode, or using whole-line completion (:help compl-whole-line) in insert mode. After editing a command, you can:

Press Enter to execute the current line (and close the command-line window); or
Press Ctrl-c to edit the command; or Press Ctrl-c twice to close the command-line window (cancel).
